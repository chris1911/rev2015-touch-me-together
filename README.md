# Touch me together

> Multiplayer rhythm game released at the [Revision 2015](http://2015.revision-party.net/) with 122 players!

A master screen displays the track (ideally with a huge video projector) and plays the audio. Party people grab their smartphone, go to a specific URL, and play together.

Because it was specifically made for the Revision, there is only one song, which includes a tutorial section. Moreover it was made over two weeks, so don't expect anything.

## Installation

	npm install
	node .

By default, the master screen go to <http://localhost:3000/#password> and party people to <http://localhost:3000/>. The master can exit from a loop by pressing the right arrow, and write a custom message on the screen by pressing Enter.
